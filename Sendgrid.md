***If you already have an Azure account set up for billing, you will be taken to a page where you can create a subscription.***

***A form will load with a Subscription Name field. You must add a name â€” we recommend something that clearly differentiates the subscription. All the other fields are already populated and cannot be edited. Click Create.***
