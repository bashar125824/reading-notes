# What is Entity Framework Core ?

***Entity Framework Core is the new version of Entity Framework after EF 6.x. It is open-source, lightweight, extensible and a cross-platform version of Entity Framework data access technology.***

***Entity Framework is an Object/Relational Mapping (O/RM) framework. It is an enhancement to ADO.NET that gives developers an automated mechanism for accessing & storing the data in the database.***

***EF Core is intended to be used with .NET Core applications. However, it can also be used with standard .NET 4.5+ framework based applications.***

***The following figure illustrates the supported application types, .NET Frameworks and OSs :***

***EF Core can serve as an object-relational mapper (O/RM), which:***

- *Enables .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects.*
- *Eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that typically needs to be written.*


## The model :

***With EF Core, data access is performed using a model. A model is made up of entity classes and a context object that represents a session with the database. The context object allows querying and saving data.***


***EF supports the following model development approaches:***

- ***Generate a model from an existing database.***
- ***Hand code a model to match the database.***
- ***Once a model is created, use EF Migrations to create a database from the model. Migrations allow evolving the database as the model changes.***


## Querying


***Instances of your entity classes are retrieved from the database using Language Integrated Query (LINQ). For more information, see Querying Data.***


## Saving data

***Data is created, deleted, and modified in the database using instances of your entity classes***


## EF Core Development Approaches :

***EF Core supports two development approaches:***

1. **Code-First** 
2. **Database-First**

***EF Core mainly targets the code-first approach and provides little support for the database-first approach because the visual designer or wizard for DB model is not supported as of EF Core 2.0.***

# Data Seeding

***the process of populating a database with an initial set of data. There are several ways this can be accomplished in EF Core: Model seed data. Manual migration customization. Custom initialization logic.***

## Why a Data Seed System ?


***While EF Core Data Seeding system provides a way, it is very limited and doesn't cover production scenarios. Also, it is only for EF Core.***

***ABP Framework provides a data seed system that is :***

- **Modular** : *Any module can silently contribute to the data seeding process without knowing and effecting each other. In this way, a module seeds its own initial data.*

- **Database Independent** : *It is not only for EF Core, it also works for other database providers (like MongoDB).*

- **Production Ready**: *It solves the problems on production environments. See the "On Production" section below.*

- **Dependency Injection**: *It takes the full advantage of dependency injection, so you can use any internal or external service while seeding the initial data. Actually, you can do much more than data seeding.*


## Model seed data


***Unlike in EF6, in EF Core, seeding data can be associated with an entity type as part of the model configuration. Then EF Core migrations can automatically compute what insert, update or delete operations need to be applied when upgrading the database to a new version of the model.***


## Limitations of model seed data


***This type of seed data is managed by migrations and the script to update the data that's already in the database needs to be generated without connecting to the database. This imposes some restrictions:***

- **The primary key value needs to be specified even if it's usually generated by the database. It will be used to detect data changes between migrations.**

- **Previously seeded data will be removed if the primary key is changed in any way.**

# What is User secrets ? 

***User secrets is a secure way of storing private user information such as API keys, client secrets, and connection strings. Essentially anything that you donâ€™t want others to know about when using your code base.***
