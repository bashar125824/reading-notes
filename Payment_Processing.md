***For newcomers, going online with credit card processing can be a daunting and confusing task.  You will need to go through a number of steps, some of which are complicated in their own right and loaded with paperwork.  There are also a bewildering series of terms, some of which even have the same meaning.  Hopefully, a systematic look at the process can shed light on how online credit card processing works.***

## Merchant Accounts

***It all starts with your bank checking account.  When you have that in place you will need a Merchant Account.  The Merchant Account is how you connect to the credit card processing network.  It is this account that makes sure credit cards are processed correctly and safely – your bank account does not process credit cards.  Merchant Accounts accept (or decline) credit cards and ultimately transfer the funds into your bank account.  It visually makes sense if you think of the Merchant Account as the old card-swipe machine.***

## Payment Gateway

***The Payment Gateway is responsible for sending the credit card to the appropriate Internet Merchant Account over secure online channels.  The approval or decline of the transaction, however, is actually performed by the Merchant Account.  It is helpful to think of the Gateway as a router that sends the credit card information to the appropriate account.  It is also responsible for fraud checking and maintaining reliable links with the merchants.***

## Your Application

***Your application can interact with the Payment Gateway in a number of different ways.  For simple applications, such as a shopping cart program, the user may simply be transferred to a web page on the Gateway for credit card processing.  When the transaction is complete, the user is transferred back to the application.  At no point does the application handle the credit card information.***

## summary of how the process would work if you had an application such as online registration:

- **User enters credit card information into the application**
- **Credit card information is sent to the Payment Gateway via a secure channel**
- **The Payment Gateway routes the credit card to the appropriate Internet Merchant Account**
- **Internet Merchant Account connects to the Merchant Account for credit card processing**
- **The result is passed back to the Gateway and then the application**

## Fees

***Although we’ve worked through the key concepts of online credit card processing, we still have one last area of confusion, which are fees.  Admittedly, the number of fees can be quite confusing, but the general formula is usually straight forward.***

***The Merchant Account will have one or more of these fees:***

- **One-time setup fee**
- **Recurring monthly fees**
- **Per Transaction fees** 

***The Payment Gateway and, possibly, the Internet Merchant account will have this structure:***

- **One-time setup fee (typically in the $100-200 range)**
- **Recurring Monthly Fee (typically in the $20-60 range)**
- **Per Transaction fee.**
