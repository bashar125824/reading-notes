# What is Unit testing ?

---

***my definition for Unit testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers. Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness. A unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object.***

# Why we need Unit testing ?

---

***Unit Testing is important because we sometimes try saving time doing minimal unit testing and this is myth because inappropriate unit testing leads to high cost Defect fixing during System Testing , If proper unit testing is done in early development, then it saves time and money in the end.***

# How can we do Unit Testing ?

---

***There is 2 ways to perform Unit Testing :***

- **Manually**
- **Automatically**

---

# What is Documentation : 

---

***It's text that accompanies software code to explain what your code is doing, why it's written the way it is, and/or how to use it***

---

# Importance if Decumentation :

***Decumentation explains the specific features of a project, informs how we can work with them, helps us to understand the project's functionality, and allows us to reduce onboarding costs.***

# README art :

---

***I liked a qoutation in the article "No README? No abstraction" and in my opinion if there is no README file for any project , I will be very annoyed , becuase I have to dive in the code itself , to figure out how the program runs , and that's harder from writing the code itself !***

# README Best Practices :

---

***I discovered a lot of practicies that I never used to do , like following simple instructions to get perfect README file***
