# SQL Preb-Work

***understanding of relational databases and SQL :***
1. Database management systems (DBMS) are computer programs that allow users to interact with a database. A DBMS allows users to control access to a database, write data, run queries, and perform any other tasks related to database management.

2. Thanks to their flexibility and design for data integrity, relational databases are still the primary way data are managed and stored more than fifty years after they were first conceived of. Even with the rise of various NoSQL databases in recent years, understanding the relational model and how to work with RDBMSs are key for anyone who wants to build applications that harness the power of data.

# Terminal Observations :

1. ***The command line :*** I use the **ls** command usually , but after reading , I discovered a new thing , that I can use **-l** option , but to be honset , I didn't git the idea from using it ! So I will continoue use the **ls** alone !

2. ***Basic Navigation :*** I wasn't know the **pwd** command , but it's a very useful command , I know the **cd** command , but I noticed a new thing , that I can use **../../** with **cd** to return backward in path , I used to do a stupid thing like : **cd /the path** , I will never do that !

3. ***More About Files :*** the **-a** option is new for me , that's it 

4. ***Manual Pages :*** this is a new material for me , I didn't use any of **man** , **man -k** or **n** command before , but yeh , it's an interisting thing to know the functionality of each commmand .

5. ***File Manipulation :*** I know most of these command but copy command **cp** is a new thing to me , it saves a lot of time .

6. ***Cheat Sheet :*** Overall , I learned a lot of new commands that I didn't know anything about it before  , and I noticed a new details in some commands that wasn't 100% clear for me .
